    def seasonal_patterns(self):
        """Analyze monthly/seasonal trends"""
        # Check for patterns based on month or season
        # Return seasonal insights
```

### 2. Prediction Engine

```python
class LottoPredictionEngine:
    """ML-powered lottery number prediction"""
    
    def __init__(self, analytics):
        self.analytics = analytics
        self.models = {}
        self.initialize_models()
    
    def initialize_models(self):
        """Initialize prediction models"""
        # Set up various prediction models
        # Configure default parameters
    
    def frequency_based_prediction(self):
        """Generate predictions based on frequency analysis"""
        # Use hot/cold number analysis
        # Balance between frequent and infrequent numbers
        # Return ranked number selections
    
    def pattern_based_prediction(self):
        """Generate predictions based on identified patterns"""
        # Use gap analysis and positional preferences
        # Apply pattern matching algorithms
        # Return pattern-based selections
    
    def ml_ensemble_prediction(self):
        """Generate predictions using machine learning ensemble"""
        # Apply Random Forest for classification
        # Use Neural Network for pattern recognition
        # Combine predictions with weighted ensemble
        # Return ML-based selections with confidence scores
    
    def monte_carlo_simulation(self):
        """Generate predictions using statistical simulation"""
        # Run multiple simulations based on historical probabilities
        # Aggregate results to identify high-probability combinations
        # Return simulation-based selections
    
    def hybrid_weighted_prediction(self):
        """Generate predictions using all methods with custom weights"""
        # Combine all prediction methods
        # Apply user-configurable weights to each method
        # Return comprehensive predictions with confidence ratings
    
    def generate_quick_picks(self, count=5):
        """Generate random selections with optional constraints"""
        # Create random number combinations
        # Optionally apply constraints (e.g., sum range, even/odd balance)
        # Return quick pick selections
    
    def generate_smart_picks(self, strategy='balanced', count=5):
        """Generate analyzed selections using specified strategy"""
        # Apply selected prediction strategy
        # Generate multiple sets based on strategy parameters
        # Return smart pick selections with confidence ratings
    
    def lucky_number_integration(self, lucky_nums):
        """Incorporate user's lucky numbers into predictions"""
        # Ensure user's lucky numbers are included
        # Build remaining selection around lucky numbers
        # Return personalized selections
    
    def risk_assessment(self, numbers):
        """Assess probability and risk level of a selection"""
        # Calculate historical probability of the combination
        # Assess risk level based on various factors
        # Return risk assessment with explanation
```

## Integration with Existing Scraper

The GUI and predictor components will integrate with the existing scraper as follows:

1. **Data Flow**
   - Scraper collects data and stores it in CSV/SQLite
   - Analytics module processes the data
   - Predictor engine generates predictions
   - GUI displays data and predictions

2. **Component Interaction**
   - GUI triggers scraper for data updates
   - Scraper notifies GUI when updates are complete
   - GUI requests predictions from predictor engine
   - Predictor engine accesses data via analytics module

3. **File Structure**
